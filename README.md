These are a few simple projects that I programmed using JavaScript.

<h3>Pizza Menu</h3>
A menu used to order pizza with various toppings. It receives user input and calculates a price for the order. Be Prepared: This menu contains ingredients local to the Dune Sea of Tatooine (a fictional planet in <i>Star Wars</i>).

<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

<h3>Calculator</h3>
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.

<h3>Specialty</h3> 

Quick demos of jQuery, React.js, JSON, and/or XHTML in action. See the To-Do List app for an example of all of these in action.
